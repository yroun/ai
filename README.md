### Explanation:

1. **Class Definition**: A `Model` class simulates how an AI language model is structured.
  
2. **Initialization**: The constructor initializes the model with training data and builds a knowledge base.

3. **Tokenization**: The `tokenize` method splits text into tokens, which helps in understanding queries.

4. **Generating Responses**: The `generate_response` method processes a user query and finds relevant responses from the knowledge base.

5. **Selecting Best Response**: The `select_best_response` method determines the most suitable response based on the available candidates.

6. **Example Usage**: An example demonstrates how to create an instance of the model and query it, producing a response.

This pseudo-code abstracts the complexities involved in natural language processing but conveys the core ideas of how I function as a language model.
